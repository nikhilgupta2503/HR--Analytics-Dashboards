# HR--Analytics-Dashboard

In this Power BI project, we delve into comprehensive insights related to employee attrition and various key performance indicators (KPIs). The project focuses on analyzing employee dynamics, enabling informed decision-making and fostering a better understanding of workforce trends.

The project's KPIs include the count of employees, providing an overview of the workforce size, and the attrition rate, shedding light on the rate of employee turnover. The average age and average salary metrics offer insights into the composition of the workforce and compensation structures.

The project incorporates a range of dynamic visualizations. Top charts reveal attrition trends based on education, salary, age, job role, and years of service. Understanding these patterns can aid in identifying potential areas for improvement in retention strategies. Additionally, the visualization of attrition by year at the company and employees' gender distribution provides a comprehensive view of the organization's evolving employee landscape.

By leveraging Power BI's interactive capabilities, this project equips stakeholders with actionable insights, facilitating better human resources planning, and enabling strategies to enhance employee engagement and retention.
